# 📘 Reddit Comment Sentiment Analysis — Experimentation

This repository contains all the **experimentation work** for building a complete **Reddit Comment Sentiment Classification System**.  
It focuses on **data preprocessing, NLP pipeline creation, model experimentation, imbalance handling, and feature extraction techniques**.

The goal of this repo is to explore ideas, compare multiple approaches, and identify the best-performing model before deploying it into production.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This experimentation workflow includes:

- ✔ Classifying Reddit comments into **Positive**, **Negative**, and **Neutral**  
- ✔ Full **NLP preprocessing pipeline** (cleaning → tokenization → lemmatization)  
- ✔ Feature extraction using **TF-IDF** and **Bag-of-Words**  
- ✔ Training multiple ML models for benchmarking  
- ✔ Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization  
- ✔ Complete experiment tracking using notebooks

## 🧪 Experiments Included

This repository contains every major experiment needed to build a robust NLP model:

- Text cleaning & preprocessing  
- Tokenization & Lemmatization  
- Stopword removal  
- Handling imbalanced dataset  
- TF-IDF & BoW vectorization  
- Training multiple ML models:  
  - **KNN**  
  - **Logistic Regression**
