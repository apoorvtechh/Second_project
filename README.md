TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words feature extraction




Multiple ML models with hyperparameter tuning




Full experimentation workflow stored as notebooks


## 🧪 Experiments Included


This repository contains every major type of ML/NLP experiment, including:




Baseline Models




BoW vs TF-IDF comparison




N-gram range experiments (1,3)
